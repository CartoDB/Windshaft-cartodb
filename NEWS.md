## 2.14.0

Released 2015-09-30

Summary: this starts using Windshaft as library (aka version 1.0.0), it no longer extends old Windshaft server.

Announcements:
 - Upgrades windshaft to [1.0.0](https://github.com/CartoDB/Windshaft/releases/tag/1.0.0)

New features:
 - Named tiles: /api/v1/map/named/:name/:layer/:z/:x/:y.:format

Ported from Windshaft pre-library:
 - Almost all acceptance tests, some unit and some integration tests
 - Stats + profiler

New features:
 - Named maps MapConfig provider
 - Base controller with: req2params, send response/error mechanisms
 - Authentication/Authorization moves to its own API so it can be reused
 - Surrogate-Key headers for named maps and affected tables

Improvements:
 - No more fake requests to emulate map config instantiations
 - As named maps previews are using named map MapConfigProvider it doesn't need to load the MapConfig
 - Controllers using Windshaft's backends to request resources through MapConfig providers
 - Express 4.x, as Windshaft no longer provides an HTTP server, here we start using latest major version of Express.
 - assert.response implemented using request
 - All tests validate there are no unexpected keys in Redis and keys requested to be deleted after a test are present
 - Test suite in Makefile generated with `find`
 - Image comparison with `mapnik.Image.compare`
 - Doesn't emit Named map update event on unmodified templates

TODO:
  - Named map provider checks on every request if named map has changed to reload it (actually reset it so MapConfig has to be regenerated). See https://github.com/CartoDB/Windshaft-cartodb/commit/f553efa69e83fdf296154ab1b7b49aa08957c04e. This is done this way because when running the Service in a cluster there is no communication between different instances so when a named map gets updated in one of the them the rest is not aware/notified of the change. In the future there should be a mechanism to synch this changes between instance:
   * endpoint
   * redis pub/sub
   * backdoor

Released 2015-01-26

Announcements:
 - No more signed maps (#227 and #238)
    - Splits template maps endpoint into its own controller
    - Removes TemplateMaps dependency on SignedMaps
     - Token validation is done against the template
     - Template is always extended with default values for auth and placeholders
     - MapConfig is extended, in order to validate auth_tokens, with template info:
        - template name
        - template auth
     - No more locks to create, update or delete templates
        - Trusting in redis' hash semantics
        - Some tradeoffs:
            * A client having more templates than allowed by a race condition between limit (HLEN) check and creation (HSET)
            * Updating a template could happen while deleting it, resulting in a new template
            * Templates already instantiated will be accessible through their layergroup so it is possible to continue requesting tiles/grids/etc.
     - Authorisation is now handled by template maps
    - Template instantiation returns new instances with default values if they are missing


New features:
 - Basic layergroup validation on named map creation/update (#196)
 - Add named maps surrogate keys and call invalidation on template modification/deletion (#247)
    - Extends TemplateMaps backend with EventEmitter
        - Emits for create, update and delete templates
    - VarnishHttpCacheBackend will invalidate a varnish instance via HTTP PURGE method
        - In the future there could be more backends, for instance to invalidate a CDN.
    - NamedMapsEntry has the responsibility to generate a cache key for a named map
        - It probably should receive a template/named map instead of owner and template name
    - SurrogateKeysCache is responsible to tag responses with a header
        - It also is responsible for invalidations given an Invalidation Backend
        - In the future it could have several backends so it can invalidates different caches
    - SurrogateKeysCache is subscribed to TemplateMaps events to do the invalidations
